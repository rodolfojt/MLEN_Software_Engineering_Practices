# Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
## Software Engineering Practices - Part 1

This is a summary sheet to main aspects os the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree course from Udacity.

# 1. Clean Code:

The code you create should be readable, simple and concise.

## Tip: Use meaningful names

* Be descriptive and imply type
    For booleans try to use 'is' or 'has' in the name.
    It is good avoid variables with a single letter names.
* Be consistent but clearly differentiate
    The standard for Python is using 4 spaces for each indent of your code.
* Avoid abbreviations and especially siggle letters (Exceptions: counters and common math variables)
* Long names is different of descriptive names
    arr: standard name to represent an arbritrary array

## Tip: Use white space properly

- Organize your code with consisten indentation;
- Separate sections with blank lines to keep your code well organized
  and readable.
- Try to limit your lines around 79 lines, which is the guideline given
  in the PEP 8 style guide.

[For more guidelines check PEP 8 Style Guide for Python.](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/?#code-lay-out)

2. Modular
    1. Functions
	2. Modules
        - Encapsulating code into Files

## Tip 1: DRY (Don't repeat yourself)

## Tip 2: Abstract your logic to improve readability

## Tip 3: Minimize the number of entities (functions, classes, modules, etc.)

## Tip 4: Functions should do one thing

## Tip 5: Arbitrary variables names can be more effective in certain functions

## Tip 6: Try to use fewer than three arguments per functions

3. Refactoring Code
    1. Why?
        1. Reduce workload in long run
        2. Easier to maintain code
        3. Reuse more of your code
        4. Become a better developer
