# Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
## Software Engineering Practices - Part 2

This project intend to cover some exercises and a main aspects summary of the Software Engineering Practices which were addressed during Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program second module.

## 1. Testing Code:

Your corde can seem to work smoothly if:
- Some values were completly encoding incorrectly
- Inappropriate features
- Unexpected features

Difficult to find errors, because you need to check the quality and accuracy of your analysis, beyond the quality of your code.

#### Unit Tests

- Tests that covers a small unit of code, commonly a function independent of the rest of the program.

- Tool: [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)

#### Test Driven Development

- Writing tests before developing code to implement tasks
