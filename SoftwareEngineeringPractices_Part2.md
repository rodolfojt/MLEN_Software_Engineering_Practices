# Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
## Software Engineering Practices - Part 2

This project intend to cover some exercises and a main aspects summary of the Software Engineering Practices which were addressed during Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program second module.

## 1. Testing Code:

Your corde can seem to work smoothly if:
- Some values were completly encoding incorrectly
- Inappropriate features
- Unexpected features

Difficult to find errors, because you need to check the quality and accuracy of your analysis, beyond the quality of your code.

#### Unit Tests

- Tests that covers a small unit of code, commonly a function independent of the rest of the program.

- Tool: [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)

#### Test Driven Development

- Writing tests before developing code to implement tasks


## 2. Logging 

#### Tip: Be professional and clear

#### Tip: Be concise and use normal capitalization

#### Tip: Choose appropriate level for logging (DEBUG, ERROR and INFO)

#### Tip: Provide any useful information

## 3. Code Review

Goal: Achieving a standard of quality for the whole team.

Specific errors for Data Science: data leakage, misinterpretation of features or inapropriate evaluation methods.

#### Idea: We can use code review questions to analyse our old projects and improve their code.

- Is the code **clean** and **modular**?
- Is code **efficient**?
- Is **documentation** effective ?
- Is the code **well tested**?
- Is the **logging** effective?

We need to be sure the code follows the best practices in a concise way.

#### Tip: Use a code linter

#### Tip: Explain issues and make suggestions

#### Tip: Keep your comments objective

#### Tip: Provide code examples
